_This is some muted text for subtle emphasis._

This is an example of an MDX file. You can write **Markdown** as usual, and also use React components:

<Button>Click Me!</Button>

- MDX lets you mix JSX and Markdown.
- You can import and use your own components.
- It's great for documentation and interactive content.

> This is a blockquote in MDX. You can use it to highlight important information.

here is an alert:

<InfoAlert>This is an info alert!</InfoAlert>

---

<WarningAlert>This is a warning alert!</WarningAlert>

---

<DangerAlert>This is a danger alert!</DangerAlert>

```cpp
int main() {
